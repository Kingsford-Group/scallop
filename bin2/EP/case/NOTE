1123: good example, our algorithm might work
10011: hard case because of splicing events on 3end
10121: low coverage, splice graph structure issues
10084: low coverage, identify boundaries of genes
10071: positive and negative strand
10116: positive and negative strand
10146: tiny partial exon, spanned by reads
